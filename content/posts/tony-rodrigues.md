*This is a summary of Tony’s testimony as he tells it during public appearances and interviews. The full story, told in all its detail, appears in [Ceres Colony Cavalier](https://www.amazon.com/Ceres-Colony-Cavalier-Account-Abduction/dp/B09PHH7LC7) and [Project Starmaker](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Starmaker-Cavalier-Collection-Stories/dp/B0C52JNHFP/133-0108678-1383309).*

Michael Anthony Rodrigues was born in 1972 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time of writing, Tony is 52 years old—yet he carries more than 72 years of memory.

On April 15th, 1982, after a confrontation at school with a boy who claimed his father was an Illuminati, Tony woke in the middle of the night to find gray aliens standing in his bedroom. They took him from his home and transported him to an underground or off-world facility. There, he was inducted into the 20 and Back program, also known as the Career Return program. Through exotic technologies involving cloning and consciousness transfer, Tony lived an additional 20 years of life.

After the abduction, he was brought to Inyokern. There, he underwent intensive mind programming modeled after MK-ULTRA, designed to turn him into a high-end remote viewing asset. Children in the program were placed on IVs, administered drugs, and rendered unconscious, then used to provide accurate information. While sedated, they could answer questions clearly, but afterward they remembered nothing.

In December of 1982, Tony was transferred to an island near Seattle and kept for several weeks at the home of a billionaire satanist, where occult rituals and child experimentation took place.

By 1983, Tony was put to use in the field as an operational remote viewer in Puerto Tahuantinsuyo, Peru—a tiny jungle village that functioned as a drug-trafficking hub. He worked aboard a C-46 Commando aircraft tasked with running shipments of cocaine toward Santa Marta, Colombia, a route that took roughly ten hours each way.

At the midpoint of every flight, his handler wrapped him in a Faraday blanket, inserted an IV, and administered a ketamine derivative. Tony would lose consciousness and begin providing accurate information about police locations and safe places to land. His intelligence proved so reliable that by the end of his two-year stay in the jungle, the handler was also using him to answer questions from villagers while he was under. The handler carried a clipboard filled with questions and charged the villagers money for Tony’s answers.

Around puberty, the system began to fail. Tony started speaking incoherently during sessions. His usefulness declined. He was sent back to Seattle and returned to the billionaire’s home, where he was kept with other boys.

The house hosted political fundraisers. Thousands attended during the day. At night, the crowd dispersed. The real donors remained. Sexual abuse of young boys and girls followed. It was filmed.

We all know that story.

Tony spoke publicly about this in 2015. The Hillary email scandal broke the following year.

After Seattle, Tony was sold to the military and shipped to the far side of the moon. On the way, he saw through the windows that he was being sent to a trapezoidal base whose architecture was based on the Pentagon. They said they saved money by converting the original design into a base that could function in vacuum.

Another round of trauma-based mind control followed. The focus was fight or flight. Tony was trained not to run. Along with other children, he was placed in an arena and forced to defend himself against massive insects—enormous, fast, and violent.

Later, the group was transferred to Mars aboard a large triangular craft. They were taken to an underground city, bags placed over their heads, then flown to a small forward base hidden under a crevice. They stepped out of artificial gravity and into Mars gravity. Missions followed—combat operations against insect humanoids.

During one mission, Tony and other soldiers encountered a particularly dangerous insectoid. They were badly injured and evacuated for healing. The forward base was eventually shut down. The insectoids adapted too quickly.

The soldiers were brought back to the underground city. Tony was reassessed by a gray alien instructor using the same adaptive training software employed throughout the military. His aptitude test placed him in the category of “skilled labor.” He was shipped to the planetoid Ceres.

On Ceres, Tony worked aboard a UFO performing maintenance and fire suppression. The craft had been built from two submarines bolted together and converted by German engineers. The ship traveled backward in time every day, leaving and returning at the same moment. Work assignments arrived from a computer.

Every day.

For eight years.

Like *Groundhog Day*.

The events of Project Starmaker happened during this period, in which Tony endured ten additional years of labor that, from the ship’s perspective, occurred in an instant.

Time travel is a bitch.

Eventually, the ship was decommissioned. Tony was reassigned to a newer stealth craft built on a chassis leased from a non-human species. He was promoted to cargo engineer and placed in charge of seven people. The job restored some dignity.

At the front of the ship stood a tower filled with psychics. Their function was defensive: blocking extraterrestrial remote viewing of the ship’s capabilities and scanning of personnel. The psychics were human, drug-assisted, and positioned just outside the ship’s protective field.

Tony managed cargo—stacking, weight distribution, remaining space. The ship made frequent runs to Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory.

The Ceres Colony Corporation operated beneath the surface of the planetoid, its cities carved into massive underground caverns. The architecture was distinctly European, and the inhabitants identified with Deutsche culture. Tony had a girlfriend there, a lady of the night, and over time they fell deeply in love, something neither of them was meant to have.

At the venue where she worked, a foyer housed an anti-gravity art exhibit where spheres of fire and water floated freely. Micro-gravity switched on and off, creating violent splashes of flame and liquid. Tony found it mesmerizing and would sit there watching until he was finally kicked out.

When his twenty year term ended, he was demoted and rushed out without the ceremony most people received. He was returned to the moon base and subjected to industrial-strength hypnosis and drug programming to erase his memories. The deletion of names worked.

Tony didn’t want to return. He was in love. He was livid. He fought it. They sent him back anyway.

He woke up on April 16th, 1982, in his childhood bed. Something was wrong. He was completely changed. His father took a photograph that day—one Tony still keeps. He didn’t know who he was.

He was devastated, though he remembered none of it at the time.

Years later, the memories returned. One afternoon, without warning, twenty years flooded back into his mind. Tony believes the recall was made possible thanks to love—his enduring bond with the woman he left behind on Ceres.

Disclosure, in this world, has already happened.

Now, we want participation.
