Jean-Charles Moyen was contacted at the age of four while on a beach in France with his parents. He was playing in the sand when, for a brief moment, his mother looked away. When she looked back, he was gone. Lifeguards searched for over an hour without success. His parents, devastated, sat on the sand. Then, suddenly, Jean-Charles reappeared in front of them as if nothing had happened.

He later explained that he had been surrounded by a hot, bright light and lifted off the ground. He found himself seated on a substance that molded to his body as he moved, levitating. Four beings of light surrounded him and reassured him telepathically. The communication conveyed a sensation of unconditional love, like a heart entering his body and filling him with calm and peace. The beings were intensely bright, almost angelic. Through windows, he could see space and the Earth below, which frightened him because he did not want to leave his parents. One of the beings placed a hand on his head, appeared to check something, and moments later he was back on the beach.

After this experience, Jean-Charles began to develop unusual abilities, including telepathy and telekinesis. These manifestations often occurred when he was emotionally upset or exhausted and were frequently associated with light or electricity. In one instance, while in a supermarket with his mother, he felt extremely tired. He closed his eyes, clenched his hands, and thought about recharging himself. At that moment, the lights in the entire aisle shut off. His mother asked if it was him, and he said yes. When she told him to turn them back on, the lights returned.

Similar electrical disturbances occurred whenever he felt sad. He could recharge batteries by holding them for a few seconds. As a child, he communicated telepathically with his dog and cat and could heal them through touch. He could direct his dog to retrieve a specific ball without speaking.

His dreams were unusually vivid. His family lived on the ninth floor of an apartment building in Paris. One night, he dreamed he was in the Bahamas. When he woke up, his face was deeply tanned, and white sand was between his toes. His parents were astonished. There was no white sand in Paris. His father, protective, chose not to tell anyone.

Encouraged by his father, Jean-Charles began to experiment further. One night, he focused on the universe and woke up on another planet. There were beings resembling humanoid cats and dogs. Crystals grew from trees and water sources, and the water itself was red. When he woke up, he wished he had brought something back.

The following night, he went to sleep wearing a backpack containing an empty plastic bottle. He returned to the same planet, encountered the same beings, and filled the bottle with red water containing a crystal. When he woke up, the backpack contained the bottle, filled with red water and the crystal. His parents witnessed this and were stunned.

Later, at school, during an exam, Jean-Charles raised his hand to ask to go to the bathroom. No one responded. He realized everyone around him was frozen in place. He left the classroom on his own. When he closed the bathroom door, the lights went out. He reached for the switch. When the lights came back on, he was no longer at school but in his parents’ apartment, several kilometers away.

The school later had to call a locksmith to open the bathroom door. Inside were Jean-Charles’s school bag, pen, ID card, coat, and clothes. The door had been locked from the inside. This was a case of physical teleportation, not astral travel.

At twelve, Jean-Charles was asleep in his bedroom when he heard a noise and became unable to move, held in place by an unseen force. The following night, determined to understand what was happening, he slept on his back so he could open his eyes. The noise returned. He saw a shadow standing motionless in his room. When he said, “I see you,” it did not move. When he repeated it, the shadow approached and resolved into a tall being over six feet in height, with green skin, no hair, and red eyes without pupils.

The being sat at the foot of his bed and said, “Hello. My name is Victor. I am here to protect you.” Victor explained that he existed at a different frequency and was not meant to be seen, then disappeared.

Two days later, Victor returned and said he had obtained permission from the Galactic Confederation to remain in contact, as something unusual was about to happen and he had been assigned to protect and guide him.

Not long after, Jean-Charles’s mother was alone in their apartment, reading near a reflective copper surface. She sensed someone behind her and, in the reflection, saw Victor leaning over her shoulder, looking at what she was reading. The encounter confirmed that Victor was not a product of her son’s imagination.

At thirteen, Jean-Charles attended a summer camp. During a mountain hike, he failed to wear a hat and suffered a severe sunstroke. He became dangerously dehydrated and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. He complained of a sensation like a heartbeat inside his head, prompting doctors to order an X-ray of his brain.

Each attempt to perform the scan caused the X-ray machine to malfunction. Eventually, the scan succeeded and revealed a metallic capsule in his brain, shaped like a small Tic Tac candy and resembling an implant.

He was kept under observation for several days. One day, doctors entered his room accompanied by military personnel. While examining the X-ray images, Jean-Charles overheard one of the men speaking German. Suddenly, a mask emitting green gas was placed over his mouth and nose, and he lost consciousness.

That night, a white-haired man with blue eyes in a military uniform woke him and said they had to hurry or they would miss “the jump.” Jean-Charles followed him through hospital corridors to a large elevator, where two men in black suits with red triangles on their chests were waiting.

The elevator descended far longer than expected for a hospital. Jean-Charles began to panic, and the lights flickered violently. The man placed a hand on his shoulder and reassured him. The lights stabilized instantly.

When the elevator stopped, a different metallic opening had appeared. The space beyond was clearly not a hospital basement. They entered a massive hangar where many children were lined up. The man told Jean-Charles this was where he would leave him and that everything would be fine. An inner voice confirmed it.

Jean-Charles was guided to a table where a woman asked him to place his hand on a device resembling a photocopier. A scanning light passed over his hand for DNA recognition. She gave him a black suit marked with a winged horse emblem and directed him toward a tunnel of light.

He entered the portal alongside other children. A violent tingling surged through his body, like thousands of needles piercing him at once. His consciousness cut out for a split second. When it returned, he was standing in another hangar that appeared futuristic and military in nature. Medical staff and uniformed personnel immediately began testing the children’s fear responses.

The children were separated by age and gender. Over the following weeks, they were tested on speed, logic, and adaptability. The evaluations intensified, covering clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, telekinesis, and fear tolerance through nightmarish simulations. Many children failed. One doctor identified Jean-Charles to a military officer as the boy he had mentioned earlier. Jean-Charles recognized him as the radiologist.

He was then led into a dark room where a massive mantis-like being emerged from the shadows. The being placed a limb on his shoulder and communicated telepathically that he had been chosen. Jean-Charles collapsed.

He later awoke in his hospital bed, then lost consciousness again.

He next became aware of the sound of a bus horn. He was seated with his bag, traveling back to summer camp. He had missing time. When he told the other boys what he remembered, they mocked him.

That night, he told his roommate he was going to leave the chalet through the window to walk in the nearby field at the base of the mountain. Sitting alone under the stars, he said aloud that he did not want to be there anymore and asked to be taken away. A star above him began to move, transforming into a disc. A beam of light enveloped him, lifting him into a large spacecraft.

Aboard the ship, called the *Solaris*, the first being to greet him was Victor. A blonde woman named Maria, pale with blue eyes, told him to follow her. She led him down a long corridor into a futuristic classroom where desks floated in the air and other young beings were present. This marked the beginning of his training for a secret space program.

Among the children, only one felt familiar: David Rousseau, another French boy. When Maria seated them together, they recognized one another immediately, as if they had known each other across lifetimes.

Training involved the development of psychic abilities, combat skills, and constant evaluation. Jean-Charles received specialized instruction and worked closely with a mantis being. The trainees visited multiple worlds and encountered many different species in preparation for future missions.

At the end of the training period, Maria returned and told him they would see each other again sooner than he expected. They entered a chamber containing a tube, and Jean-Charles was reinserted into his life on Earth at the moment just before he had left the chalet.

At twenty-one, during his mandatory French military service, Jean-Charles was injured and hospitalized at a military hospital in Paris. Following a medical incident, he was taken underground and treated using advanced technology. He passed through corridors of pulsating blue light and experienced the familiar needle-like sensations.

He appeared aboard the *Solaris*, where Maria greeted him, saying, “Hello again. You see, it was not so long.” He did not recognize her.

She led him into a room filled with vertical tubes. After they entered one together, his memories returned fully. He was then given a new suit bearing a circular symbol with an open triangle at the bottom and escorted into a large amphitheater, where David was already present.

Beneath a massive emblem depicting a planet with two rings, Maria addressed the assembled group. At that moment, Jean-Charles’s adult 20-and-back service for the French secret space program began.

Jean-Charles later learned that the *Solaris* was part of the Solar Warden program, a joint initiative between the United States and France. As an adult, he rose to the rank of captain and later commander, leading mixed teams of humans, hybrids, and extraterrestrials on rescue and diplomatic missions.

During a rescue mission on Mars, Jean-Charles and David encountered a hostile Black Draco. Jean-Charles was critically injured. David’s team intervened and evacuated him to the *Solaris* medical section, where crystalline medbed technology restored him fully.

After twenty years of service, Jean-Charles underwent molecular regression, returning his body to the age of twenty-one. His memories were erased, and he awoke in the military hospital in Paris.

Years later, memories resurfaced. Jean-Charles Moyen and David Rousseau independently recovered matching details of their experiences. When they later met, they confirmed they had served together aboard the same ship. Their books, films, and interviews corroborated one another in precise detail.

As an adult working at a French bank, Jean-Charles encountered his former summer camp roommate, who told him he had followed him into the field that night and witnessed him disappear into a disc of light. That confirmation removed any remaining doubt that the experience had been real.
