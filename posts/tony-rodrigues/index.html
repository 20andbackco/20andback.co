The full story, told in all its detail, appears in Ceres Colony Cavalier and Project Starmaker.\nMichael Anthony Rodrigues was born in 1972 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time of writing, Tony is 52 years old—yet he carries more than 72 years of memory.\nOn April 15th, 1982, after a confrontation at school with a boy who claimed his father was an Illuminati, Tony woke in the middle of the night to find gray aliens standing in his bedroom. They took him from his home and transported him to an underground or off-world facility. There, he was inducted into the 20 and back program, also known as the Career Return program. Through exotic technologies involving cloning and consciousness transfer, Tony lived an additional 20 years of life.\nAfter the abduction, he was taken to Inyokern. There, he underwent intensive mind programming modeled after MK-ULTRA, designed to turn him into a high-end remote-viewing asset. Children in the program were placed on IVs, administered drugs, and rendered unconscious, then used to provide accurate information. While sedated, they could answer questions clearly. Afterward, they remembered nothing.\nIn December of 1982, Tony was transferred to an island near Seattle and kept for several weeks at the home of a billionaire satanist. Occult rituals and child experimentation took place there.\nBy 1983, Tony was being used operationally in the field as a remote viewer in Puerto Tahuantinsuyo, Peru—a small jungle village that functioned as a drug-trafficking hub. He worked aboard a C-46 Commando aircraft running cocaine shipments toward Santa Marta, Colombia, a route that took roughly ten hours each way.\nAt the midpoint of every flight, his handler wrapped him in a Faraday blanket, inserted an IV, and administered a ketamine derivative. Tony would lose consciousness and begin providing accurate information—police locations, safe landing zones. His intelligence proved so reliable that by the end of his two-year stay, the handler also began using him to answer questions from villagers while he was under. The handler carried a clipboard filled with questions and charged villagers money for Tony’s answers.\nAround puberty, the system began to fail. Tony started speaking incoherently during sessions. His usefulness declined. He was sent back to Seattle and returned to the billionaire’s home, where he was kept with other boys.\nThe house hosted political fundraisers. Thousands attended during the day. At night, the crowd dispersed. The real donors remained. Sexual abuse of young boys and girls followed.\nIt was filmed.\nWe all know that story.\nTony spoke publicly about this in 2015. The Hillary email scandal broke the following year.\nAfter Seattle, Tony was sold to the military and shipped to the far side of the moon. During transit, he saw through the windows that he was being sent to a trapezoidal base whose architecture was modeled after the Pentagon. The explanation given was practical: converting the original design saved money and allowed the structure to function in vacuum.\nAnother round of trauma-based mind control followed. The training focused entirely on fight-or-flight response. Tony was conditioned not to run. In these “classes,” the programming emphasized that in a combat emergency, flight was not an option. The conditioning played out through elaborate internal scenarios that always ended the same way: it was better to give your own life for your brother, no matter what.\nTony and other children were placed in an arena and forced to defend themselves against massive insects—enormous, fast, and violent.\nLater, the group was transferred to Mars aboard a large triangular craft. They were taken to an underground city, bags placed over their heads, then flown to a small forward base hidden beneath a crevice. They stepped out of artificial gravity and into Mars gravity. Missions followed—combat operations against insectoid humanoids.\nDuring one mission, Tony and other soldiers encountered a particularly dangerous insectoid. They were badly injured and evacuated for healing. The forward base was eventually shut down. The insectoids adapted too quickly.\nThe soldiers were returned to the underground city. Tony was reassessed by a gray alien instructor using the same adaptive training software employed throughout the military. His aptitude test placed him in the category of “skilled labor.” He was sold and shipped to the planetoid Ceres, where he remained for over a decade.\nOn Ceres, Tony worked aboard a UFO performing maintenance and fire suppression. The craft had been built from two submarines bolted together and converted by German engineers. The ship traveled backward in time every day, leaving and returning at the same moment. Work assignments arrived from a computer.\nEvery day. For eight years. Like Groundhog Day.\nProject Starmaker unfolded during this period. Tony endured ten additional years of labor that, from the ship’s perspective, occurred in an instant—layered on top of the previous twenty.\nTime travel is a bitch.\nEventually, the ship was decommissioned. Tony was reassigned to a newer stealth craft built on a chassis leased from a non-human species. He was promoted to cargo engineer and placed in charge of seven people. The job restored some dignity.\nAt the front of the ship stood a tower filled with psychics. Their role was defensive: blocking extraterrestrial remote viewing of the ship’s capabilities and scanning of personnel. The psychics were human, drug-assisted, and positioned just outside the ship’s protective field.\nTony managed cargo—stacking, weight distribution, remaining space. The ship made frequent runs to Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory and missions across the solar system. Venus, Saturn, and Pluto were off limits. Venusian civilization was too technologically advanced to challenge. Pluto was controlled by a hostile alien species.\nWith his promotion came limited freedom. Tony began earning money and was allowed to leave the military complex he had been confined to for eight years. He could withdraw paper currency at a trade counter that also handled blockchain-based transactions. Alien species visiting the colony under trade agreements were permitted to exchange assets there.\nThe Ceres Colony Corporation operated beneath the surface of the planetoid, its cities carved into massive underground caverns. Civilian areas included malls, restaurants, and electric vehicles. Most food was produced by replicators, though luxury restaurants served real meat. The architecture was distinctly European, and the inhabitants identified with Deutsche culture. The military leader of the colony held the title of Führer.\nBecause of his slave collar, Tony was not respected in most public areas. To avoid harassment, he spent much of his free time in the red-light district. Extra-species sex was common. Sometimes intercourse occurred only mentally, and the girls involved were deeply damaged by it.\nTony had a girlfriend there—a lady of the night. Over time, they fell deeply in love, something neither of them was meant to have. At the venue where she worked, a foyer housed an anti-gravity art exhibit where spheres of fire and water floated freely. Micro-gravity pulsed on and off, producing violent splashes of flame and liquid. Tony found it mesmerizing and would sit watching until he was finally kicked out.\nWhen his twenty-year term ended, he was demoted and rushed out without the ceremony most people received. He was returned to the moon base and subjected to industrial-strength hypnosis and drug programming to erase his memories. The deletion of names worked.\nTony didn’t want to return. He was in love. He was livid. He fought it.\nThey sent him back anyway.\nHe woke up on April 16th, 1982, in his childhood bed. Something was wrong. He was completely changed. His father took a photograph that day—one Tony still keeps. He didn’t know who he was.\nHe was devastated, though he remembered none of it at the time.\nYears later, the memories returned. One afternoon, without warning, twenty years flooded back into his mind. Tony believes the recall was made possible by love—his enduring bond with the woman he left behind on Ceres.\nDisclosure, in this world, has already happened.\nNow, we want participation.\n","wordCount":"1328","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://20andback.co/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://20andback.co/posts/tony-rodrigues/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"20 and back","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://20andback.co/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://20andback.co/ accesskey=h title="20 and back (Alt + H)">20 and back</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://20andback.co/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://20andback.co/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Tony Rodrigues</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p><em>This is a summary of Tony’s testimony as he tells it during public appearances and interviews.
