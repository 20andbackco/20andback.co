Before she could fully understand the question, they took her straight to what they called the Elitist Academy, a government-affiliated school for gifted children somewhere near Fort Lewis, Washington, where ultra soldiers were trained. There were only five children in her class at the time. Kids came from all over the world. Morgan attended intermittently, pulled from school during gymnastics or collected on weekends. She was deeply neglected by her divorced parents. Her twenty-year-old mother was distracted by a boyfriend and rarely noticed when Morgan was gone.\nAt the academy, Morgan was trained in energy work, magic, hand-to-hand combat, gymnastics, and remote viewing, learning to visualize the locations of objects, humans, and non-human entities. There were multiple tracks: intelligence, remote viewing, the Monarch program, and others. Morgan was placed primarily in intel and remote viewing. Each time she was returned home, her mind was wiped and replaced with carefully implanted false memories.\nTrauma testing began when she was eight. The children were called experiments. Strength was forged through torture-based techniques: waterboarding, staged encounters with lions and alligators brought inches from their bodies, engineered moments of near death. Under extreme terror, Morgan’s consciousness fractured. A line split her mind, forcing part of her into a separate compartment of her soul. She was then subjected to electroshock therapy and MK-Ultra–style mind-splitting protocols, programming her like a machine. An alter personality was created, Mia 369, designed to function as a spy.\nMia was undeniably her, but stripped of emotion and attachment. She felt no sexual attraction, yet understood how to weaponize it. She knew Morgan existed. She dressed provocatively as a tactical choice, not desire. Ultra soldiers like Mia were covert operatives rather than battlefield super soldiers. By fourteen and fifteen, Mia was being deployed to adult environments, including pool parties and intelligence traps, drawing on training that included pole dancing. Over time, Morgan evolved enough to hold both sets of memories.\nA specific code phrase was used to activate Mia over the telephone. The moment Morgan heard it, the switch occurred. After sleep, Morgan would return. When she was fifteen, the call came. The phrase was spoken. Morgan separated, told her father she was leaving for the weekend with friends, and an SUV arrived. It took her to a private jet bound for an underground facility near Houston operated by MILAB, a testing ground for experimental technologies developed in collaboration with non-human intelligence.\nIn the underground base, Morgan was introduced holographically to five extraterrestrial races as preparation for remote viewing assignments. The teenagers studied their anatomy and agendas. After the briefing, they were taken to meet a reptilian being in person. It was the most terrifying experience of her life. The reptilian sat on a throne. When it spoke telepathically, its presence overwhelmed her nervous system and paralyzed her completely. Terror flooded her body, pure and absolute. The being was winged and regal, vibrating with immense power. All it said, in a voice that hissed through her bones, was, “You do not need to fear me today.” Morgan carried an implant that translated all alien speech into English. The other boys were enthralled by the reptilian, intoxicated by its dinosaur-like authority.\nThat night, the teenagers stayed in a Houston hotel. The following day, they were taken to an abandoned-looking building that housed a hidden science lab. On the top floor was Project Looking Glass. At the center of the room floated a sphere of mercury, suspended three feet above the ground inside a transparent casing. One chair faced it. A mad scientist type stood beside her, attaching electrodes to Morgan’s forehead and fingertips before strapping her into the chair. Everyone else stood at the back of the room as the machine activated.\nThe mercury ignited in shades of purple, green, and blue, forming a luminous cube that enveloped the sphere. A ribbon of light spiraled outward and became a screen. It showed Morgan’s future memories from her own perspective. Time could be scrubbed forward and backward. She saw herself at protests for disclosure outside the White House, on missions in space alongside multiple alien species, standing in a massive courtroom before hundreds of people. When it ended, the children were sent home. Immediately afterward, Morgan underwent extreme mind programming. Once they saw she would become a future liability, they implanted self-destructive and self-sabotaging behaviors, including intense self-harm drives, to prevent her from ever speaking out.\nAt sixteen, both Morgan and Mia were exhausted. They had been deployed too often and pushed too far. For the first time, they rebelled. They wanted out. Morgan was taken to an Illuminati initiation party, a display of power and reward meant to secure her loyalty. A contract was drafted by the Illuminati and the CIA, designed to make it appear she was released while covert programming continued. She was shown an offer of $300,000, though it was purely symbolic, knowing her memory of it would be erased. After signing, all memories of the academy, the Illuminati, and the CIA were suppressed. False memories were implanted, convincing her she was a drug addict. She woke the next day craving hard drugs, with no memory of what had been done to her.\nMorgan was later forced by her mother, likely financially incentivized, to enlist in the Army. She joined in 2003 at eighteen as a computer networking specialist. After one year, a USAF commander brought her into a private room and offered her a classified opportunity known as a 20 and back, twenty years in space followed by a return with no memory of it. He told her she could never speak of it. She didn’t care. The offer felt like destiny, and she accepted immediately.\nThe next day, she boarded a craft from an underground terminal. They emerged from Earth and entered a warped spacetime corridor. Though the trip could have been instantaneous, it lasted three days to acclimate the crew. The ship was small, circular, and sparsely crewed.\nOn the Moon, Morgan was placed in healing chambers to bring her body to peak condition. Physical health was emphasized above all else. She received new uniforms, assignments, and briefings. Command explained that many men in space had not seen women in years. To protect her, she was placed in officer training to ensure rank and authority. It was known that some men misused memory wipes to cover misconduct, which was part of the reason her rank mattered.\nMorgan attended officer school near Alpha Centauri. Multiple galactic races trained there under a coalition framework. Only five humans were present. She studied psychology, determined to improve humanity’s reputation. Humans, she learned, occupied the lowest tier of the galactic social hierarchy.\nHer first mission placed her on a classified stargate team. The portal was man-made and connected to a galaxy-wide network, appearing like weightless, flowing water. Only one person aboard knew how to operate it. Reptilians were deeply involved in the project. Human-reptilian cooperation was volatile. The team jumped once a month, scouting Earth-like planets as contingency habitats. Psychic operatives astral-projected ahead to assess environments. The risks were severe, and two team members died within a year.\nMorgan later accepted a post on Venus. Entry required atmospheric freefall inside individual energy bubbles, magnetically drawn into a surface facility protected by a force field. Inside, the structure glowed with blue marble and gold hieroglyphics. To reach the cities, dimensional elevation was required. A triangular doorway stood there like a hole punched out of time and space, buzzing as she stepped through, her DNA structure was being upgraded. On the other side was a vast civilian city embedded within a military base.\nShe provided security for Arcturian botanists developing healing serums. The Arcturians were tall and blue, marked with gold geometric tattoos and pronounced bone structures at the temples. They were beautiful, with a feminine energy, and everything they spoke seemed to come straight from the source. At her post, Morgan had fun playing with a belt that could change the appearance of the physical body. The belt could alter hair color, eyelashes, or nails, or add a tail or other superficial details because of the lower density on Venus. She got into trouble helping civilians beyond her orders and was reassigned as punishment.\nHer next posting was Mars. The ship entered through cavern systems into the planet’s interior. She served as military police in mining zones that felt like prison camps, filled with scarcity, despair, and exploitation. Water was precious. She remained there for five years.\nBy the time her military service brought her to Saturn, Morgan had risen to the rank of Major. The core of Saturn housed triangular bases interconnected by hyperspeed tunnels: bronze for intelligence, silver for military training, and gold under exclusive reptilian control. Massive halls hosted interstellar assemblies. Outside stood statues of extinct civilizations, reminders of what failure looked like. Direct intervention in planetary evolution was forbidden; influence was limited to inspiration through indirect actions and ideas.\nLife in space was isolating. There were no traditions and it was difficult to form lasting bonds. When Morgan threatened to leave, her superiors enticed her to stay by offering something unprecedented: her own ship. It was grown from her DNA, cultivated in a tank before expanding rapidly into a twenty-crew fighter. The ship was a conscious organism without emotion. Only Morgan could activate it, and she communicated with it telepathically through a natural connection. Later, she learned the ship had also been designed for use by Mia.\nOn a secret mission to the planet Gula, Morgan’s crew was sent to assist Venusians during a civil war. Secretly, reptilian command ordered the theft of a rare mercury compound. While the planet burned, the mercury was taken and later used in Earth’s Looking Glass project.\nAfter twenty years, Morgan was returned to the Moon for age regression. She spent seven sessions submerged in blue biogenic fluid. Vibrational healing restored her cells. Her long-term memories were blocked through neural imaging. Once her body was rejuvenated, her consciousness was transferred into a younger version of herself in Earth’s timeline, the day before she left for space in Fort Lewis.\nAt thirty-three, Morgan began to remember. A spontaneous awakening activated all her chakras at once. Energy lifted her from her bed, spun her, and slammed her to the floor. Rainbow light struck the back of her head. Her mind unfolded. Space, missions, allies, everything returned. With it came abilities: teleportation, intergalactic navigation, communion at the galactic core. She learned that such gifts emerge only through neutrality, compassion, and love. If humanity resolved its inner wars, there would be no outer ones.\n","wordCount":"1843","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://20andback.co/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://20andback.co/posts/morgan-rae-johnson/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"20 and back","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://20andback.co/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://20andback.co/ accesskey=h title="20 and back (Alt + H)">20 and back</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://20andback.co/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://20andback.co/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Morgan Rae Johnson</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p><em>This account is compiled from multiple public interviews given by Morgan.
