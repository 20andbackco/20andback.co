&lt;p&gt;As a child, Jason Rice had a knack for slipping away unnoticed, earning a reputation as an escape artist. He often wandered off, only to be brought back home by police or concerned strangers. His parents made him wear dog tags with their contact information in case he got lost. But after being returned home by the same police officer several times, his parents were warned that if they didn&amp;rsquo;t keep better control of him, he could be taken into state custody. Terrified by the possibility, they frantically searched for a solution and eventually enrolled him in a behavioral program at a local university.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
